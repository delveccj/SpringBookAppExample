# 📚 Book Review Similarity App

Welcome to the **Book Review Similarity App**!  
This is a Java web application built with **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf** that allows you to explore a list of books and view other books that are similar based on the content of their reviews.

---

## 🧠 What Does This App Do?

- Loads a list of books from a file (`books.json`)
- Displays those books in a dropdown menu on a webpage
- When you select a book:
  - It shows you the full review
  - It calculates and displays the **top 3 most similar books** using **cosine similarity** based on their review content

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf (HTML templating)
- Maven (build tool)
- JSON (for book data)

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

### ✅ Requirements:
- Java 17+
- Maven

### ✅ Steps:

```bash
# 1. Move into the project directory
cd book-review-app

# 2. Start the app
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 🧮 How Similarity Works

Each book has a small numeric **vector (embedding)** that represents the meaning of its review.

When a book is selected, the app:
- Calculates the **cosine similarity** between that book’s embedding and every other book’s embedding
- Sorts the results by similarity score
- Displays the top 3 most similar books

This simulates how AI models can group similar ideas by meaning!

### ▶️ What Happens When You Run `mvn spring-boot:run`?

1. **Spring Boot starts up your app**
   - It scans your project for annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, `@Controller`, `@Service`, etc.

2. **It wires everything together**
   - Spring automatically connects your classes, like controllers and services — no manual setup needed.

3. **It starts an embedded web server**
   - Usually Tomcat, running locally on port `8080`

4. **It listens for web requests**
   - Like when you visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

5. **It routes the request to your code**
   - The controller method (`@GetMapping("/")`) runs, loads data, and returns a view

6. **Thymeleaf renders the HTML**
   - It fills in the dynamic parts using your model data and sends the final HTML to the browser

✅ Result: your app is running like magic — no WAR file, no external Tomcat, no config headaches.

## 💡 What Can You Modify?

Here are some ideas:
- Add new books to `books.json`
- Show similarity scores in the UI
- Style the page with CSS
- Add a search box or sort filter
- Replace books with **consumer complaints**
- Add a REST API layer (extra credit!)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Getting a `javax.annotation` error?
You're likely on Java 17+. This project already uses:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.annotation</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta.annotation-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure your `BookRepository.java` uses:
```java
import jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;
```
